**` Aspiring Software Developer `**

I'm a University of Utah graduate with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business. During my time at university, I was a dedicated member of the Division 1 lacrosse team for four years and served as the vice president of the Cybersecurity club during my final semester. My academic and extracurricular experiences have fueled my passion for both software development and cybersecurity. I'm actively seeking opportunities in these fields to apply my skills and continue growing as a professional.
