# Jarrod King

**` Aspiring Software Developer `**

I'm a University of Utah graduate with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Business. During my time at university, I was a dedicated member of the Division 1 lacrosse team for four years and served as the vice president of the Cybersecurity club during my final semester. My academic and extracurricular experiences have fueled my passion for both software development and cybersecurity. I'm actively seeking opportunities in these fields to apply my skills and continue growing as a professional.

<summary><h3> Jarrod's Coding Journey </h3></summary>

I started coding in my freshman year of college. Having excelled in math and science courses in high school, I saw Computer Science as an intriguing new frontier. When I began coding, I fell in love with the problem-solving aspect and the satisfaction that comes with overcoming challenging problems. Although I felt like I was a step behind in the software world because I didn't start coding until college, this pushed me to become proficient at picking up new skills quickly. I am excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to projects that can make a positive impact around the world!
